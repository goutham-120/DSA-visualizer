# ðŸš€ DSA Visualizer

A cross-platform interactive **Data Structures & Algorithms Visualizer** built in C++. Designed to simulate and explain core DSA concepts using real-time terminal animations and ANSI styling.

âœ… Cross-platform: Works on Windows 10+, Linux, and macOS terminals  
âœ… Zero dependencies: No external libraries used  
âœ… Real-time visualizations: ANSI-based animations  
âœ… Modular design: Each algorithm in its own folder with clean separation

### ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented
- Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm  
- Sliding Window Technique  
- Two Pointer Technique  
- Prefix Sum  
- Monotonic Stack  
- Binary Search on Answer  
- Recursion + Backtracking

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file and folder with terminal-based step-by-step simulation.

### ðŸ›  Requirements
- C++ compiler (`g++`, `MinGW`, `TDM-GCC`, etc.)
- Any terminal: CMD, PowerShell, VS Code Terminal, Linux/macOS Terminal
- Operating System: Windows 10+, Linux, or macOS

### ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
